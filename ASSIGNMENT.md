Hi Wouter,

I enjoyed our conversation and would like to invite you to an assessment, which is the second step of our hiring process for Software Engineers. The assessment consists of a sit down with one of our engineers to discuss an example Ruby on Rails application that you will have to build as preparation for the technical assessment. The goal is to gain a better understanding of your technical skills, experience, problem solving skills and learning ability. You can pick a timeslot that best suits you.

If you're not comfortable with Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails yet, you will also have to do some studying beforehand. There's many great resources to be found online but a great place to start is Agile Web Development with Rails 7. Please note that this link is for your personal use only.

Some other things you could do are:

1. Subscribing to weekly Ruby and Ruby on Rails newsletters to keep track of and learn about different libraries and releases;
2. Learning about and experimenting with other technologies we use like: PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Terraform, ElasticSearch, OpenAPI, OAuth, SAML;
3. Trying out different Ruby gems we rely on: Devise, Nokogiri, Haml, Carrierwave, Capybara, Sidekiq, Prawn, AASM.

Once you've gotten the basics down, you will have to create a (small) example Ruby on Rails project about a subject that interests you, so use your own imagination and creativity here. Are you going to build yet another blog application? Or will you come up with something more original? This is your chance to show off your skills! Bonus points if your application uses the technologies and/or gems mentioned earlier. This example project will be discussed with you as part of the technical assessment.

Best of luck and see you soon! Please bring your laptop, with the example project up and running.
